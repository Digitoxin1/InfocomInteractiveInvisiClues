				"Although A Mind Forever Voyaging (hereafter referred to as AMFV) is not as puzzle-oriented as most of Infocom's previous works of interactive fiction, you may get stuck on a puzzle, or simply not know what to do next. The purpose of InvisiClues hint booklets is to maximize your enjoyment by giving you only the hints you need to continue and complete the story.",
				"The invisible hints generally progress from a gentle nudge in the right direction to a full answer. The questions, which naturally have to be visible, have been worded to give away as little as possible.
