				"The essence of all interactive fiction is solving problems. The purpose of InvisiClues hint booklets is to maximize your enjoyment of the story by giving you only the hints you need to continue and complete the story.",
				"The invisible hints generally progress from a gentle nudge in the right direction to a full answer. The questions, which naturally have to be visible, have been worded to give away as little as possible. You should not use the presence or absence of a question on a certain topic as an indication of importance, and you should not assume that long answers are associated with important questions. This booklet includes dummy questions and answers in order to minimize the problem."
