				"The essence of all INTERLOGICâ¢ games is solving problems. The purpose of InvisiClues hint booklets is to maximize your enjoyment of the game by giving you only those hints that you need to continue playing and complete the game.",
				"The invisible hints generally progress from a gentle nudge in the right direction to a full answer. The questions, which naturally have to be visible, have been worded to give away as little as possible. You should not use the presence or absence of a question on a certain topic as an indication of importance, and you should not assume that long answers are associated with important questions. This booklet includes dummy questions and answers in order to minimize this problem."

			"title": "How to use this booklet",
			"content": [
				"Those of you who have used an InvisiClues book before will find this one a bit different. Due to the interrelated nature of DEADLINE's problems, many of the questions themselves are invisible. Do not develop any of the \"Hidden Questions\" until you are directed to do so.",
				"If you are stuck at some point in DEADLINE, find the question that most pertains to your problem. Uncap the marker and run it once over the first hint. The writing will appear within a second or two. If you are still stumped, go on to the next hint. (Remember to recap the marker when you are done to prevent it from drying out. And by the way, these books are not immortal. InvisiClues you've developed will start to fade after six months.)",
				"For example:"
			]
		},
		"section3": {
			"content": [
				"Your marker contains more than enough fluid to develop the entire booklet. However, if your marker gets lost or dried out, you can order a replacement marker for a nominal fee.",
				"Once you have finished DEADLINE, try the things in the \"For Your Amusement\" section. Don't look at them before you've finished, though â they may reveal the answers to certain problems."

They cite the lack of a motive or the means to administer the drug. He is also acquitted if arrested after you have proof of murder and the documents implicating him in the Focus scandal. The jury feels the lack of means of administering the drug without a struggle is a serious flaw.",

If you arrest them after seeing the new will (or seeing George trying to destroy it), seeing the notepad note, and seeing the papers on the Focus scandal, the D.A. spends much more time interrogating them.

If you have established a motive (seen the Focus papers and read the note), Baxter is found guilty of both murders. If you have no evidence that Baxter murdered Dunbar, there are two possible endings, depending on whether you have proved a motive for Baxter to have killed Robner. In each of these endings, the jury acquits Baxter, believing that Dunbar murdered Mr. Robner and then committed suicide.",

If you haven't proved a motive with the Focus scandal papers, the grand jury refuses to indict them. If you have the Focus papers but haven't seen the note, Baxter and Dunbar are tried â and several jurors believe them to be guilty â but they are not convicted since there is nothing relating the old Focus scandal to the murder. If you have proof of murder, the note, and the Focus papers, you must still disprove Baxter's alibi for the night of the murder (most of the jurors will vote to convict, but a couple of them will feel there is reasonable doubt). Only if you have gotten conflicting stories from Baxter and Dunbar about the night of the murder by confronting them with the ticket stub while the other is not in the room to hear the story, can you convict the two of them."
