				"Since a major element of interactive fiction is solving puzzles, players sometimes get stuck at various points in the story. The purpose of InvisiClues hint booklets is to give you just enough of a hint to allow you to still solve the puzzle on your own. Thus, you can still have the thrill of discovering the solution, and can then continue onward in the story.",
				"The invisible hints generally progress from a gentle nudge in the right direction to a full answer. The questions, which naturally have to be visible, have been worded to give away as little as possible. You should not use the presence, absence, or length of a question as an indication of the importance of the question's topic. Dummy questions and answers have been inserted to prevent you from using this hint booklet in that manner."

The writing will appear in a second or two. If, after reading and thinking about this clue, you are still stumped, go on to the next hint. (Remember to recap the marker when you are done or it will dry out. And by the way, this book is not immortal. InvisiClues you've developed will begin to irrevocably fade after around six months.)",
