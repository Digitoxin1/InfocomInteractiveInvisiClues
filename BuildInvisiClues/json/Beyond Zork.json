				"Since a major element of interactive fiction is solving puzzles, players often get stuck at various points in the story. InvisiClues hint booklets give you just enough of a hint to allow you to still solve the puzzle on your own. Thus, you can still have the thrill of discovering the solution, and can then continue onward in the story.",
				"The invisible hints usually progress from a gentle nudge in the right direction to a full answer. The questions, which naturally have to be visible, have been worded to give away as little as possible. You should not use the presence, absence, or length of a question as an indication of the importance of the question's topic. Dummy questions and answers have been inserted to prevent you from using this hint booklet in that manner."

				"If you are stuck at some point in Beyond Zork, find the question that most pertains to your problem. Uncap the marker and run it once over the first hint. The writing will appear in a second or two. If you're still stumped, go on to the next hint. (Remember to recap the marker when you are done or it will dry out. And by the way, the books are not immortal. InvisiClues you've developed will begin to irrevocably fade after a short while.)",
